# Cantori

A permadeath roguelike dungeon crawler — in the spirit of Shattered Pixel
Dungeon — built as a web game so it plays on a phone (iPhone included) with no
App Store, and eventually offline.

> **This is the GPLv3 line of Cantori.** It started as a full copy of
> [TheBigButsu/Cantori](https://github.com/TheBigButsu/Cantori) (kept there,
> untouched, as the original) and ports systems and art from
> [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon)
> by Evan Debenham, itself based on Watabou's Pixel Dungeon. Because SPD is
> GPLv3, so is this repository — see `LICENSE`, and `vendor/spd/README.md` for
> the SPD version we port from. This is not Shattered Pixel Dungeon and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by its authors.
>
> The four heroes use SPD's hero art: Chadwick wears the Warrior, Brynn the
> Rogue (blue-skinned), ToneTum the Mage and Sera the Huntress. Their outfit
> follows the armour you have on, as in SPD.

## Where we are: Milestone 4 — "The Long Way Down"

The full journey. The dungeon is **five biomes of five floors each** (25 floors,
then a win):

1. **Forest** — grass & trees · boss: **The Pied Piper**
2. **Cave** — brick & pebble · boss: **Stone Golem**
3. **Tomb** — tiled floors, stone brick · boss: **three Cultists**
4. **Arcane Tomb** — runed marble · boss: **The Mummy**
5. **The Beyond** — otherworldly · boss: **The Demi-God**

Each biome has its own tileset and monster set. The 5th floor of each is sealed
by a boss — beat it and the way down opens where it fell. Slay the Demi-God on
floor 25 and you **win**. (Bosses are big, hard fights for now; special
behaviours come later.) Content lives in `data.js` → `biomes` / `bosses`.

## Earlier: Milestone 3 — "Spoils"

Loot and growth. Levels are strewn with items — weapons, armor, gold, and
mystery potions and scrolls. Walk over something to pick it up; open your **pack**
(🎒) to equip gear or use consumables. Weapons raise your attack, armor blunts
incoming blows. Potions and scrolls are **unidentified** until you use one — a
healing draught or a mouthful of poison, you won't know until you drink it.
Killing monsters grants XP; leveling up raises your max HP and attack. Gold is
tallied for score.

Consumables: healing / strength / poison potions; magic-mapping / teleport
scrolls. Built on everything before it — turn-based combat, permadeath,
procedural dungeons, fog of war, camera, zoom, and floor map.

**Graphics:** the game now renders classic pixel-art sprites (hero, monsters,
items, terrain) from **Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup**, which are CC0 / public
domain. See `ART-CREDITS.md`. Sprites live in `assets/tiles/` and are drawn with
the torch lighting laid over them.

**Controls**
- **Phone:** tap an explored tile — the character finds a route and walks there,
  around walls, diagonals included.
- **Keyboard:** arrows / WASD, plus 8-direction keys (vi-keys `y u b n` and the
  numpad) for diagonal steps.
- **Attack:** walk into a monster.
- **Pack:** the `🎒` button or `I` — tap gear to equip it, tap a potion/scroll to
  use it; `✕` / `🎒` / `Esc` to close.
- **Descend:** step onto the `>` stairs.
- **Zoom:** pinch, the on-screen `+` / `−` buttons, the mouse wheel, or `+` / `−`.
- **Floor map:** the `▦` button or `M` — shows the whole explored level, with
  your position and the stairs; tap it (or `Esc`) to close.
- **After death:** tap the screen (or `Enter`) to start a new run.

The browser console exposes a small `window.cantori` dev helper
(`descend()`, `regenerate()`, `restart()`, `hurt(n)`, `place(x,y)`, `peek()`).

## Play it locally

No build step — it's plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

```sh
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser
```

## Content editor (no code needed)

Open **`editor.html`** (e.g. `…github.io/Cantori/editor.html`) to add, edit, or
remove monsters, gear (weapons, armor, and the ring/trinket/necklace jewelry),
consumables, and bosses through tables; shape **biomes** as cards (with a
click-to-toggle monster picker); and build **classes** with a form + a **5×5
skill tree** (5 tiers × 5 options, blank to start, hover a skill to read it).
Loot config and the design-reference tabs (stats, gods) stay as JSON. Three ways
to use your edits:

- **▶ Playtest** — saves your changes to this browser and opens the game using
  them. The game shows a green **⚙ DRAFT** badge while a draft is active; tap it
  (or **■ Stop playtest**) to go back to the live content.
- **☁ Save to GitHub** — commits `data.js` straight to the repo (auto-deploys via
  Pages, works on iPhone). One-time setup: make a GitHub **fine-grained token**
  (Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens → Generate; give it access
  to **only this repo**, Permissions → **Contents: Read and write**), paste it into
  the dialog, and hit **Save token**. The token lives only in your browser; revoke
  it anytime. After that, **💾 Commit data.js** publishes your edits directly.
- **⧉ Copy for Claude** — copies a ready-made `data.js`; paste it into the chat, or
  into GitHub's web file editor, to commit without a token.
- **⤓ Download data.js** — saves the file directly.

Your draft lives only in your browser until you export it — nothing is sent
anywhere.

## Project layout

```
index.html            the page
editor.html / .js     the content editor (admin) — tables + JSON, playtest/export
styles.css            the shell (dark, torch-lit)
data.js               ALL editable content — monsters, gear, consumables, biomes,
                      loot config, and the design-stage classes / stats / gods
loot.js               loot roll engine (rarity/tier/affix/identify) — a module
game.js               the engine — dungeon, fog, combat, UI (being split into
                      modules like loot.js to keep each file small)
DESIGN.md             the design spec (rogue-lite vision, stats, gods, town)
assets/tiles/         pixel-art sprites (CC0, see ART-CREDITS.md)
manifest.webmanifest  lets it install to a phone home screen
icons/                app icons (generated by tools/make_icons.py)
tools/make_icons.py   regenerates the icons, no dependencies
```

To tune or add content — a tougher rat, a new weapon, drop rates — use
`editor.html`, or edit `data.js` directly; you don't need to touch the engine.
See `DESIGN.md` for where the game is headed.

## The roadmap

Built one "depth" at a time, playable at the end of each:

- **0 · First Light** — walk around a room _(done)_
- **1 · The Descent** — random dungeons, corridors, fog of war, stairs down _(done)_
- **2 · Teeth in the Dark** — monsters, combat, health, permadeath _(done)_
- **3 · Spoils** — items, inventory, weapons, potions, scrolls _(done)_
- **4 · The Long Way Down** — biomes, bosses, a winnable run _(you are here)_
- **5 · Made for the Pocket** — app icon, sound, refined touch, full offline play

See `DESIGN.md` for the rogue-lite direction (stats, classes, gods, the town).
