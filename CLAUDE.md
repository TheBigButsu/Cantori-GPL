# Cantori — working rules

A permadeath roguelike that runs as a static site (no build step, no dependencies) and is served by
GitHub Pages from `main`. Read `DESIGN.md` for where the game is headed and `README.md` for what it
does today.

**This repo is GPLv3 and ports from Shattered Pixel Dungeon.** Anything taken from SPD — a
translated Java class, a sprite, a formula — is fine here, but: note the SPD source file it came from
in a comment (or in `ART-CREDITS.md` for art), port against the commit pinned in
`vendor/spd/README.md`, never remove an existing credit, and never call the game "Shattered Pixel
Dungeon" or reuse its title banner. SPD's audio has its own mixed licences (see `ART-CREDITS.md`) —
check each file before copying one. Progression here is **insight potions + gear**, not SPD's
strength potions and upgrade scrolls, and there are no wands; don't port those.

## Layout

```
index.html          the page — also carries the ?v= cache-buster (so does editor.html)
data.js             ALL editable content: monsters, gear, consumables, biomes, bosses,
                    boons, loot config, classes + skill trees, stats, gods
loot.js             loot roll engine (rarity / tier / affix / identify)
game.js             the engine — map, FOV, combat, AI, bosses, render, UI
editor.html/.js     no-backend content editor that reads and writes data.js
assets/tiles/       sprites (CC0 Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup — see ART-CREDITS.md)
tests/              headless smoke test (see below)
```

`game.js` is large and organised by `// ---- Section ----` banners. Find your way around with those
rather than by line number — line numbers move.

## Before you start

**Never read `game.js` whole.** It is ~78k tokens and growing; reading it costs real money on every task and
buries the code you need in code you don't. `docs/MAP.md` lists every section with its line range
and token cost — read your section with `Read(game.js, offset=…, limit=…)`, or Grep for a symbol.
Regenerate the map with `python3 tools/make_map.py` after moving code between sections.

Line numbers drift with every merge, so **`docs/MAP.md` is the only file that should carry
them** — briefs name sections and symbols instead. Regenerate the map before you start reading.

`docs/PACKETS.md` is the work queue: numbered, self-contained briefs in `docs/packets/`, each
naming the files it may touch and how to verify it. If you were pointed at a packet, that brief
overrides your instincts about scope.

## Rules

**1. Content is data; behaviour is code.**
Adding a monster, weapon, consumable, boon, biome or class is a `data.js` edit. Only a genuinely new
*behaviour* (a summoner, a new skill `kind`, a boss playbook) touches `game.js`. If you find yourself
writing code to add a normal monster, the framework is being used wrong.

**2. Teach `editor.js` any new `data.js` field, in the same commit.**
The editor rewrites `data.js` wholesale when the user hits "Commit data.js". A field it doesn't know
about can be silently dropped the next time content is edited in the browser. Table editors preserve
unknown scalar fields, but anything structured (a new per-biome table, a new skill-tree cell shape)
needs editor support or it will be lost.

**3. A monster's sprite ships with its data row.**
`SPRITE_NAMES` is derived from `Object.keys(DATA.monsters)` and `DATA.bosses`, and loads
`assets/tiles/<key>.png`. A data row without a matching PNG renders blank. Sprites must be CC0 or
public domain, and credited in `ART-CREDITS.md`.

**4. Bump the `?v=` cache-buster in `index.html` AND `editor.html`** whenever `game.js`, `data.js`,
`loot.js`, `bosses.js`, `styles.css` or `editor.js` changes. Every query string in both files moves
together, to the same number. Phones aggressively cache; skipping this means the user tests stale
code and reports phantom bugs.

`editor.html` is the one that bites hardest, and it has already cost real work: it sat on `?v=75`
for eight generations of `index.html`, so the editor kept loading a months-old `data.js` out of the
browser cache — and "Commit data.js" replaces the file wholesale, so every save silently reverted
everything that had landed since. The editor now refuses to commit over a `data.js` it didn't load,
but that is the backstop, not the fix. Move both files.

**5. New terrain must be added to every map predicate.**
Tiles are `WALL / FLOOR / STAIRS / DOOR / THORN / WATER / CHASM / RUBBLE / GRASS`, each a row in the
`TILE` property table. A tile with no properties is walkable, sighted-through and harmless by
default, so declare what it *is* rather than special-casing the constant. Any new tile must be
considered in:

- `passable()` (on foot) and `passableFor(mover, …)` (per-creature — a flier crosses deep water) — movement
- `isWall()` — projectiles and ranged weapons, which is a different question from "can I walk there"
- `blocksSight()` — FOV
- `floodReach()` and `allRoomsReachable()` — the generator's connectivity guarantee
- `fixOpenCorners()` — no diagonal-only wall/floor touches
- auto-travel pathing, and the renderer

**A tile that blocks movement can sever a floor.** Deep water is the live example: `paintTerrain`
vets each blob as it lands and undoes any that strands a tile, and `generateLevel` re-checks the way
onward once doors, thorns and trees are down, calling `unpaintTerrain()` if it's cut off. Anything
new that blocks movement needs the same treatment. Miss one and levels become unwinnable in ways
that only surface on rare seeds. This is the single most common way to break the game.

**6. Run the tests before committing:** `node tests/smoke.js` and `node tests/editor.js`.

**7. Keep the run deterministic-ish and permadeath real.** Death clears progress. Don't add anything
that silently rescues the player.

## Testing

`node tests/smoke.js` boots the real page in headless Chromium and drives it through
`window.cantori`, asserting no console errors and that every floor is completable. Run it after any
change to `game.js`, `data.js` or `loot.js`.

`node tests/editor.js` boots the real `editor.html`, runs the same `buildData()` the "Commit data.js"
button uses, and diffs the result against `data.js` on disk. It fails if the editor would drop or
alter a single field — which is rule 2 above, enforced. Run it after any `data.js` or `editor.js`
change.

Play it by hand with `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then open `http://localhost:8000`.

`window.cantori` (browser console) exposes a large dev surface — among the most useful:

| Call | Does |
|---|---|
| `descend()` | go down one floor |
| `regenerate()` | rebuild the current floor |
| `restart()` / `beginNewRun()` | new run |
| `place(x, y)` | teleport the player |
| `peek()` | full player/run state dump |
| `setClass(k)` / `pickClass(k)` | switch class |
| `give(k)` / `giveGear(k, o)` | spawn items |
| `grant(n)` / `learn(k)` / `doSkill(k)` | skill points and skills |
| `giveBoon(k)` | grant a boon |
| `hurt(n)` / `setGold(n)` / `setStat(k, v)` | poke the player |
| `rooms()` / `attachInfo()` | last level's room layout |

Content changes can also be tested without touching code: open `editor.html` and hit **Playtest**,
which stores a draft in `localStorage` and shows a green ⚙ DRAFT badge in the game.

**That draft outranks `data.js` until you clear it, and reloading will not clear it** — `localStorage`
is not the HTTP cache, so a hard refresh leaves it exactly where it was. One Playtest click months ago
is enough to make a freshly-reloaded editor show content from months ago. The editor now names its
source in the header (`live data.js` vs `⚙ local draft · 26h ago`) and raises a banner offering to drop
a draft that disagrees with what shipped; it also re-fetches `data.js` with `cache: "no-store"` on load
and says so if the server's copy differs from the one the `<script>` tag gave it. If content ever looks
wrong or old, read that badge first.

## Style

Match the surrounding code: plain ES5-ish browser JavaScript in one IIFE, no modules or build tooling,
two-space indent, and comments that explain *why* a rule exists (the existing comments are unusually
good — keep that bar). No new dependencies.
