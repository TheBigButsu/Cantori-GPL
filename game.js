   Cantori — Milestone 2: "Teeth in the Dark"

     - Turn-based world: when you act, everything else gets a turn.
     - Classic dungeon vermin (rat, bat, snake, spider) that wake, hunt and bite.
     - Bump-to-attack combat with hit points on both sides.
     - Permadeath: at 0 HP the run ends; begin anew at Depth 1.

   Built on the Depth 1 dungeon (procedural levels, fog of war, stairs, camera,
   zoom, floor map).

   Controls:
     - Tap / click -> walk (auto-routes when safe; single steps once a monster
       is in sight). Walk into a monster to attack it.
     - Keyboard: arrows / WASD, plus 8-direction keys y u b n and the numpad.

  // points on one axis:
  //
  //   light   — a caster's robe. Grants INT and MP outright, mitigation is thin, and
  //             it lets your WHOLE DEX modifier through uncapped — the same as bare
  //             skin. A robe is not in the way of anything, and a caster who has to
  //             choose between mana and not being hit is only ever choosing mana.
  //   medium  — the DEX-heavy answer, and the only armour where AC is a live stat.
  //             It soaks a little; mostly it makes you hard to HIT. The cap starts
  //             at +3 on a tier-1 piece and climbs by one per tier AND one per
  //             plus, so a nimble character is not held to a beginner's ceiling and
  //             an upgrade scroll literally widens what their DEX is allowed to do.
  //             Spending past your own modifier is still wasted — the cap never
  //             invents DEX you do not have.
  //   heavy   — no AC and no DEX at all, in exchange for the largest mitigation
  //             range in the game. You get hit; it barely matters. It keeps its
  //             Evasion — that is footwork you own, not something the armour grants,
  //             and taking AC off a plate build is already the price.
  //   none    — WEARING NOTHING lets all of your DEX through, uncapped. Armour caps
  //             DEX because it is in the way; there is nothing in the way of a bare
  //             body, so there is nothing to cap. AC 10 flat for a DEX-17 monk was
  //             the cap being applied by a piece of armour that did not exist.
  //             The trade is real in both directions: naked you are the hardest
  //             thing in the game to hit and you block nothing at all, since
  //             mitigation is entirely the item's defMin/defMax roll.

  // which is the same total floor divided into fewer, larger spaces — and the count
  // of rooms is what a floor feels like, because each one is an encounter.

  //                    leans on the attach path instead.
  // These are Shattered Pixel Dungeon's shape, measured from its source rather than
  // eyeballed. An SPD standard room is SizeCategory.NORMAL, and Room.setSize does
  // `resize(NormalIntRange(4, 10) - 1, ...)` with the comment "subtract one because
  // rooms are inclusive to their right and bottom sides"; Painter.fill then insets a
  // wall. So its INTERIOR is (D − 3)², a mean of about 17 tiles — not the ~25 an
  // earlier pass here assumed, which is why Cantori's floors read as bigger than
  // SPD's even while the room COUNT matched.
  //
  // Room size was never the whole story though. Shrinking rooms alone just made more
  // of them inside the same 47×47 footprint, with more corridor in between: extent
  // stayed at 36² and the walk to the stairs did not move. SPD sizes its map TO its
  // rooms (bounding box + 1 padding) and packs most of them wall-to-wall, so the
  // packing knobs — attachPct, attachCap, roomPad — matter as much as the sizes.

  // A gas is a volume per tile. Every world turn a spreading gas does what SPD's
  // Blob.evolve does: each open tile becomes the average of itself and its open
  // orthogonal neighbours, minus one — so it pours through doors, fills a room,
  // thins and dies away, and walls hold it. Fire and frost are SPD's own rules
  // instead: fire burns a tile for its volume in turns and jumps to flammable
  // neighbours (grass, bushes, doors, brambles, bookshelves — all of which burn
  // to embers, so fire only ever OPENS the map; CLAUDE.md rule 5), frost ticks
  // down in place, and each puts the other out.
  //
  // Whoever stands in a gas at the end of the turn takes its effect, monsters and
  // player alike; monsters avoid stepping into a harmful one. Everything is
  // cleared on a new floor.
  //
  // For boss playbooks: spawnGas / gasBurst / gasLine / gasRing / gasAt / clearGases
  // are passed to bosses.js in its deps. See docs/BOSSES.md.

  // say, and every one of those passes puts walls back. Measured on the FINISHED
  // map, a forest floor still carried 2.5 wings hanging off a single tile apiece,
  // half of them over 30 tiles: walk the whole wing, then walk the whole wing back.
  // The boss ring was worse, because it never ran the dead-end pass at all.
  //
  // That is the "this room doesn't connect to the ring" complaint, and no value of
  // loopPct can fix it, because the severing happens afterwards. So this pass runs
  // last, on the map as it will actually be played, and only ever DIGS: it turns
  // rock into floor and walls nothing, so it cannot strand a tile and needs no
  // reachability undo (rule 5's hazard is one-directional).
  // 15 = POCKET_MAX + 1, deliberately: anything smaller is a nook, and the pass
  // below already has a better answer for those (a secret room, or sealed). Set it
  // lower and the two fight — loops dissolve the pockets before they can become

  // or "passive" (a continuous modifier). Passives may set `when` = a weapon
  // subtype they require.
  // Falls back to a class's legacy `skills` map if the tree wires nothing yet.

  // Trees were once a fixed 5×5 grid, and a prerequisite named a cell by its
  // [tier, slot] coordinate. The grid was the only thing stopping trees from
  // being real trees: a coordinate can only point at a cell that exists in the
  // row above, so a node with two parents from different rows, a diamond, or two
  // branches of unequal depth were all inexpressible. Nodes carry ids instead,
  // and prerequisites name ids.
  //   node = { id, x, y, name, icon, kind, when, desc, levels, ranks,
  //            req: ["id", …], reqAny: [["id", minRank], …] }

  // player.skills, the hotbar and the dev hooks are keyed by never changed; only
  // the way prerequisites address each other did.
  //
  // normalizeTree accepts EITHER shape and always hands back the flat one. It is

  // ---- "Am I actually playing the current build?" -------------------------
  // Two entirely separate things can hand a phone months-old content, and
  // NEITHER of them is fixed by reloading — which is the whole reason this
  // check has to exist:
  //   1. a Playtest draft in localStorage outranks data.js, and localStorage is
  //      not the HTTP cache, so a hard refresh leaves it exactly where it was;
  //   2. index.html itself can come out of the cache, and index.html is the file
  //      carrying the ?v= for every script — a stale shell asks for the OLD
  //      version of data.js, game.js and loot.js, so bumping ?v= does nothing.
  // The editor has named its source in the header for a while. The game only had
  // a small badge, and a badge you must already know to look for is not a
  // diagnostic: it cost a round of "the update isn't live" against a build that
  // had shipped hours earlier. So the game now asks the server what it actually
  // serves and says, in the player's face, which of the two is happening.
  // The ?v= this page was served with, read off our own <script> tag. It is the
  // one number that says which build is actually running, and until now it was
  // only visible in View Source — which on a phone is not visible at all.
